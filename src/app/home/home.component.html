              Gbenga Samuel-Wemimo Ministry International, GSWMI, has been 
              raised by the Holy Spirit to equip the saints as they sort out 
              their Homo Christus (Christ-kind) status in their walk with the
               Holy Spirit. The Messianic Community is not ordinary, 
               and believers are not ordinary by any standard. The ministry's
                mandate is to bring Neppios (Baby Christians) to the point of 
                maturity in the things of the Spirit by the leading of the Holy 
                Ghost. Believers will henceforth live as Christ 
              and The Word instructs and not tossed to and fro by the elements 
              of this world.
          <!-- Gbenga Samuel-Wemimo is a minister of the Gospel, 
          an evangelist, a counsellor, a discipler, a teacher 
          and a preacher whose gift through the power of the 
          Holy Spirit is for the edification of the church and
          deepening the Individual believer's walk with the Holy Spirit... -->

                  The Pneuma School of the Supernatural Bible College, PSSBC, is a school
                   where Believers who thirst for more of God or have come to the 
                   understanding that there is more to being a Believer than going to 
                   church. PSSBC teaches the average
                   believer that he is not ordinary and can live the life of the 
                   supernatural.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They are taught the simplicity of the Gospel backed up by the 
                  demonstration of power. In the last 2 years, 5 classes have been launched
                   with many individuals starting off their very own ministerial assignments
                </p>
                <p>

                  Praying in Tongues for One hour and then an illuminating class session.

                  The Citizenship of Zion Foundation School is mainly for 
                  those who just gave their life to Christ due to the one on one 
                  ministration from the students of the PSSBC and also for those who have 
                  applied themselves in understanding the liberation power of the gospel 
                  thereby 
                  bringing them to knowledge on who they are and how God actually sees them.

                  The GSWMI Healing School is, as the name implies a school for 
                  those who are sick. When I say sick, I mean all manners and kinds 
                  of sicknesses. The Holy Spirit 
                  has used this school to set many captives free from the bondage of sickness.

                  Dearly beloved, if Jesus Christ went about doing good and 
                  healing ALL manners of SICKNESSES, do you know it is totally wrong 
                  when you say God does not want to heal you because of what you have 
                  done? How can a God who desires 
                  for ALL men to be saved be seen as One who cannot heal some sicknesses?
